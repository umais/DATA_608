    "The U.S. energy production map reveals distinct regional patterns that highlight the nation's energy landscape. "
    "The central and western states, particularly Texas, Wyoming, and North Dakota, emerge as high energy producers "
    "(shown in blue), functioning as net exporters with robust production capabilities across multiple energy sources. "
    "Texas stands out with its massive production of 25.3 trillion GWh, primarily from natural gas and wind. "
    "In contrast, coastal states including California, New York, and most of New England (shown in red) demonstrate "
    "lower production levels relative to their consumption, making them dependent on energy imports from other regions."
)

paragraph2 = (
    "The energy mix varies significantly by region, reflecting each area's natural resources and policy priorities. "
    "Coal remains dominant in Wyoming and West Virginia, while natural gas leads in Texas and Pennsylvania. "
    "Nuclear energy provides significant baseload power in states like Illinois and Pennsylvania, while wind energy "
    "has gained prominence in the Great Plains states. The vulnerability scores indicate each state's exposure to "
    "potential energy disruptions, with higher scores (closer to 1.0) suggesting greater dependency on external sources "
    "and less diversified energy portfolios."
)

vulnerability_paragraph = (
    "The vulnerability score (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0) serves as a critical indicator of energy security, with lower "
    "values representing stronger resilience. States like Texas and Wyoming show minimal vulnerability (scores near 0), "
    "indicating self-sufficiency and export capacity. Meanwhile, states with higher scores face greater exposure to "
    "supply disruptions, price volatility, and transmission constraints. These regional disparities highlight the need "
    "for robust interstate transmission infrastructure and strategic energy policy to enhance national energy security "
    "while supporting the ongoing transition to cleaner energy sources."
)

data_source = (
    "Data Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) State Energy Data System (SEDS), "
    "which provides comprehensive state energy statistics. The data includes production and consumption "
    "figures for all energy sources, allowing for detailed analysis of energy flows and dependencies "
    "between states. More information available at: https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/"
